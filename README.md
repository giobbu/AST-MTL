# AST-MTL
Accurate road traffic forecasting is crucial in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The challenge relies on the dynamic nature, the uncertainty, and the non-linear spatio-temporal dependencies of traffic. This paper proposes a novel multi-task learning model, called AST-MTL, to perform multi-horizon predictions of the traffic flow and speed at the road network scale. The strategy is based on a multi-head attention mechanism to learn related tasks in parallel while improving generalization performance. Moreover, a graph convolutional network (GCN) and gated recurrent unit network (GRU) extract respectively the spatial and temporal features of traffic conditions. Our experiments employ a new set of GPS data related to heavy goods vehicle driving in Belgium. The experimental results prove our model can effectively perform multi-horizon network-wide traffic forecasting by outperforming state-of-the-art models.
